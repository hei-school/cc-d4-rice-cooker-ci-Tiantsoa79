# Rust Project

## Rust Clippy

This project uses [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) as a linter for ensuring code quality and adherence to best practices in Rust.

### Installation

To install Clippy and its dependencies using `rustup`, use the following commands:

```bash
# Install Clippy with rustup
rustup component add clippy
```

### Usage

To run Clippy and lint the project, use the following command:

```bash
# Run Clippy
cargo clippy
```

## Coding Standard

This project follows the [Rust Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/) to maintain a consistent coding style.

## Installation and Execution

1. Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. If not, download and install them from [Rust official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Install project dependencies (if any):

    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```

5. Execute the program:

    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

## Editor Integration

For a better development experience, consider using the Rust plugin for your preferred editor (e.g., [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) for VSCode). This can provide additional features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and error checking directly within your editor.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a consistent coding style, utilize a powerful linter, and enhance your development workflow while working on the Rust project.
